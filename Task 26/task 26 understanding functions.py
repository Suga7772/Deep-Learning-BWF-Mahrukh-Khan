# Understanding Optimizers, Last-layer Activations,
# Loss Functions and Evaluation Metrics

# last layer activation: useful constraints on networks output IMDB c
# classification uses sigmoid in last layer which isnt any last layer activation
# loss function binary_crossentropy , where our imdb example used mse and so on.
# optimizers got rmsprop as its default learning rate
